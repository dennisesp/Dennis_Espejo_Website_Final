Hey Everyone! Welcome! I’m Dennis Espejo, and my work explores how geography and spatial dynamics shape access to higher education for Latine communities in urban settings. On this page, you’ll find insights into my research projects, data visualizations, and reflections on how critical quantitative methods and geographic thinking can illuminate pathways to educational equity. I invite you to explore my work, share your thoughts, and connect with me as we navigate the complex intersections of place, race, and opportunity in higher education.
